# Smarter Energy Auctions: Neural Network Estimation of Counterfactual Bayesian Nash Equilibria

This paper examines optimal auction design in energy markets, focusing on the Colombian electricity sector. We recover marginal cost functions using bootstrapping and kernel-based methods, and compute counterfactual Bayesian Nash Equilibria through neural network estimation.

This repository contains all code and documentation used in the analysis.
The structure of the repository is as follows:

Datos/ – Databases and raw input data.

Notebooks/ – Jupyter notebooks for data processing, the bootstrap procedure, and estimation of marginal cost functions.

Results/ – Outputs from the bootstrap experiments and other empirical results.
